# Basic Typed Stack

This is a very small Java project I developped for school. I'm not very good at Java but I tried to write something clean.
Basic Typed Stack has been developped to work into the console, there is not GUI version. It uses Counter class from Basic Clock for the test.

    ~% javac *.java
    ~% java Main
    *** TEST START ***
    Counter stack initializing...
    Counter stack initalized:
    Counter #3[ class Counter@13250954 class Counter@8030483 class Counter@12416126 ]
    Getting the last pushed Counter...
    Outputing popped Counter (class Counter@12416126) end value: 30
    Current Counter stack state:
    Counter #2[ class Counter@13250954 class Counter@8030483 ]
    *** TEST END ***
